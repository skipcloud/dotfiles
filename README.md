## Dotfiles

This repo mainly contains my dotfiles but also includes other things like my Brewfile.

### Installation

To install these files you will need `stow` installed. If you are using Mac you
can install using Homebrew: `brew install stow`. Or if you're on linux some
variation of `sudo apt-get install stow` will do the trick.

- Clone this repo into your home directory `git clone git@github.com:skipcloud/dotfiles $HOME/dotfiles`
- Run `make install`
