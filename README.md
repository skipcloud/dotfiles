## Dotfiles

This repo mainly contains my dotfiles but also includes other things like my Brewfile.

### Installation

To install these files you will need `stow` installed, which can be installed through Homebrew: `brew install stow`

- Clone this repo into your home directory `git clone git@github.com:skipcloud/dotfiles $HOME/dotfiles`
- Run `make install`
- If needed run `make brew` to run the Brewfile
